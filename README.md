unfriended-flask
================

Rebuild of [unfriended (php)](https://github.com/mcardillo55/unfriended) app using Flask framework. Mostly just to get exposure to Flask.

Project is currently pretty crippled due to Facebook API changes. Uses a hacky workaround of parsing the user-provided HTML source of their Facebook friends page
